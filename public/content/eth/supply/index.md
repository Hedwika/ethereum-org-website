# ETH Supply and Issuance {#eth-supply-and-issuance}

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This article is written for beginners with no prior knowledge. However, to fully understand the topic, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of concepts such as [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/#introduction-to-ethereum-improvement-proposals), [Proof-of-work (PoW)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), [Proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/), and [The London Upgrade](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#eip-1559).

## How Many ETH Tokens Are There Today? {#current-eth-supply}

As of now, there are approximately **120.43M ETH (November 2024)** in existence. This number is constantly changing due to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system and the mechanisms introduced in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), which burns a portion of ETH with every transaction. 

If you’re curious, you can track live updates on platforms like [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money).

Ethereum’s supply and issuance are essential metrics for understanding the health and future of the network. But what exactly does ETH issuance mean? Let’s break it down.

## Why ETH Supply and Issuance Matter {#why-eth-supply-matters}

In traditional finance, central banks control the supply of money, often printing more to stimulate economies. Ethereum, on the other hand, operates on a transparent and predictable system governed by its code. Knowing how many ETH exist and how quickly new ETH is issued helps:

- **Build Trust**: The Ethereum community can verify supply and issuance data directly from the blockchain.
- **Understand Value**: The relationship between issuance and ETH burn rates impacts ETH’s inflation or deflation, influencing its value over time.
- **Track Network Health**: Changes in issuance and burn rates reflect the activity and security of the network.

## What is ETH Issuance? {#eth-issuance}

ETH issuance refers to the process of creating new ETH as rewards for validators who secure the Ethereum network. It’s separate from total supply, which is the total amount of ETH in circulation.

### In simple terms:
- **Issuance** adds new ETH to the network.
- **Burning** (introduced by EIP-1559) removes ETH from the network by destroying a portion of the transaction fees.

These two forces determine whether Ethereum’s supply grows (inflationary) or shrinks (deflationary) over time.

## ETH Supply and Issuance Today {#eth-supply-today}

Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system has drastically reduced ETH issuance compared to its earlier Proof-of-Work (PoW) model. Validators—who lock up ETH to secure the network—earn ETH as rewards. Currently, the network issues around **0.55% of the total supply annually**.

However, this number is dynamic. Thanks to EIP-1559, when network activity is high, ETH burn rates can surpass issuance, creating a deflationary effect. For example, during periods of high demand, like NFT launches or DeFi activity, more ETH may be burned than issued.

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)

These platforms offer real-time updates on how issuance and burn rates are shaping Ethereum’s supply.

## Factors Influencing Future ETH Supply and Issuance {#future-eth-supply}

Ethereum’s future supply isn’t fixed—it depends on several variables:

1. **Staking Participation**: 
   - More validators joining the network means more ETH rewards are distributed.
   - Fewer validators participating may decrease issuance.

2. **Network Activity**:
   - High transaction volumes lead to more ETH being burned, potentially offsetting or exceeding issuance.

3. **Protocol Upgrades**:
   - Future changes to Ethereum’s code could adjust staking rewards or burning mechanisms, further shaping supply dynamics.

## Recap: ETH Supply, Issuance, and What’s Next {#recap}

Here’s a quick summary of what you need to know about ETH supply and issuance:

- **Current ETH Supply**: Around **120.43M ETH (November 2024)** (trackable in real-time).
- **Issuance Under PoS**: Approximately **0.55% annual increase**, significantly lower than during PoW.
- **EIP-1559’s Role**: ETH burning can make the network deflationary during periods of high activity.
- **Future Trends**: Staking participation, network demand, and protocol updates will all shape ETH supply.

Understanding ETH issuance helps demystify the value of Ethereum and its potential as a deflationary, decentralized asset. Curious about the future of ETH? Dive deeper with tools like [Ultrasound Money](https://ultrasound.money) or explore our [staking guides](/staking/).
